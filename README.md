# Report: My First Webpage

## 1. Objective
The objective of this project was to create my first webpage using **HTML basics**.  
The tasks included learning and applying different HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, buttons, tables, emojis, and forms.  
Finally, the goal was to **publish the webpage online** using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## 4. Reflection
Through this project, I learned:
- How to structure text with headings and paragraphs.
- The difference between ordered and unordered lists.
- How to add images and hyperlinks in HTML.
- How to create tables both for data and simple layouts.
- How to build a form with different input types.
- The process of publishing a website using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

This was NOT my **first step into web development**, BUT and I now understand the importance of proper HTML structure for accessibility and readability.
